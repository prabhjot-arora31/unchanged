    <h3 style="color: red;">C is a procedural programming language.Well, let's understand what is programming 
            language. You know that to conversate with anyone, one require a language.So programming 
            language is used as a translator or conversation language between human and computer.
            We, Humans understand various languages but computer understands only one language i.e binary
            i.e 0 and 1.  In the earlier ages we need very deep understanding of binary languages 
            to conversate with computer or to give an command to an computer. But today as we have
            many programming languages we don't need to understand binary language. Everything will
            be done by programming language only, only we need to understand an syntax of particular
            programming language and boom.

            C was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed 
            as a system programming language to write an operating system.
