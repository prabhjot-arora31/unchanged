            <h3>As we already now aware of some of the basics of the computer fundamentals
                and the programming languages, let's revise from the very first question
                i.e 'What is a variable?'. Consider that you have some books, but not the 
                book container, where do you store it? Afcourse you will say that you will
                arrange some container type to store it. Just like this, the variable is defined.
                Variable is a type of container to store some values in it.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Now, again you will say tha t there are different types of container,some small,large
                and also there are different things that you can store in a container.
                Same way, there are lot of types of data that you can store in these variables. These are called
                as   Data types. <a href="data_types_py.html"> You can lnow more about Data Types in this section. </a> .
            </h3> 
        </center>

            <h3>Let's start doing some programming now.
                 Consider a memory location of computer where you have stored some 
                 value let's say 50. Suppose you put the name of the address of that variable as a. 
                 So, in programming way yo will write it as follows:
                  <b><span style="color: blue;">a=50</span></b><br>
                  I know all this things are tough to understand until you start with practical.
                  So I have a different section illustrating the<a href=""> python installation and writing your very first
                  program </a>  on your PC.
